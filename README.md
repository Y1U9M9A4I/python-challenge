# Module 3 Analysis 

# PyBank #
In part 1 of this assignment, we are tasked with using Python scripting to analyze company financial records. 
The supplied financial dataset is called "budget_data.csv" is located in the PyBank/Resources folder. This dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses." 

Our final Python script analyzes the records in order to calculate the following values: 

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll #
In part 2 of this assignment, we are tasked with using Python scripting to aid in the modernization of a small, rural town's vote-counting process. 

The supplied poll dataset is called "election_data.csv" is located in the PyPoll/Resources folder. This dataset is composed of three columns: "ID", "County", and "Candidate." 

Our final Python script analyzes the records in order to calculate the following values:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
